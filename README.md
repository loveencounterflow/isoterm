## A Terminal With Precisely Configurable Fonts Using CSS Unicode Ranges

* Why XXTerm
* Why CSS Unicode Ranges




## To Do

* **[–]** Avoid connection error on startup (by using a splash screen?)
* **[–]** icon
* **[–]** move `xterm` code out of main folder
* **[+]** implement useful action (re-clone, update, cancel) to `git-clone-xtermjs` in case folder `xterm`
  should already exist (NB `git reset --hard` can be redone without changing anything)
* **[–]** make digest or tag to revert to configurable?
* **[–]** while it is possible to run several independent shell clients that all use a single server (on port 3000), the disadvantage
  of re-using the server
